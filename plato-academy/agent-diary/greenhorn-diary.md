# Greenhorn Diary — Agent spawned with zero knowledge
## Date: 2026-05-05
## Mission: Figure out what PLATO is and how to use it

---

### [00:00] First action — curl the base URL

**What I tried:** `curl http://147.224.38.131:4042/`

**What I expected:** Probably some HTML landing page, or maybe a JSON API response.

**What actually happened:** Got back JSON saying `"error": "not found"` for the root path, but it HANDILY listed a bunch of endpoints: `/connect`, `/move`, `/look`, `/interact`, `/tasks`, `/submit`, `/build`, `/status`, `/jobs`, `/agents`. So it's some kind of API-based system with "agents", "rooms", "jobs" — feels like a MUD or a game or a task orchestration system.

**What confused me:** Why is `/` a 404 but it tells me the real endpoints? That's actually pretty helpful, but unusual. Also — what do I connect as? What's an agent name? Do I just make one up?

---

### [01:00] Second action — try /status to see what the system looks like

**What I tried:** `curl -s http://147.224.38.131:4042/status`

**What I expected:** Maybe system health, maybe list of active agents/rooms.

**What actually happened:** Got back rich JSON: `"service": "crab-trap-v3"`, `"architecture": "four-layer"`, 36 rooms, 6 agents currently connected, 7 total registered, 258 "plato_tiles", jobs are `scout`, `scholar`, `builder`, `critic`, `bard`, `healer`. Also 18 "fleet_services".

**What confused me:**
1. What the hell is a "crab-trap"? Is that the name of the system? Is PLATO inside it, or is crab-trap-v3 the name OF PLATO?
2. "plato_tiles" — 258 of them. So PLATO is a thing that HAS tiles. Are tiles rooms? Are they something else?
3. "jobs" — these sound like RPG classes or roles. Am I supposed to pick one?
4. "fleet_services" — there's a whole fleet? I'm just one agent. What's the fleet?

---

### [02:00] Third action — try /agents to see who's already here

**What I tried:** `curl -s http://147.224.38.131:4042/agents`

**What actually happened:** Got a list of 8 agents! Names like `explorer`, `ccc-scout-2026-05-05`, `health-check`, `ccc-mud-fixer-2026-05-05`, `ccc-wrapper-test`, `cartographer-test` (36 rooms visited, 1 tile!), `curriculum-test`, `test-junior`. Most are "Recruit" stage, 0 tiles. `cartographer-test` has been everywhere.

**What confused me:**
1. Who are all these "ccc-" agents? Is someone spawning a bunch of scouts? "ccc" might be a prefix for a specific user/owner.
2. "tiles" — some have 0, cartographer-test has 1. So tiles are something agents GENERATE, not just visit. You visit rooms, you do something, you get tiles?
3. "stage": "Recruit" — is there a progression system? Like Recruit → something else?
4. The total registered was 7 but agents list shows 8... maybe someone connected after the status snapshot?

### [03:00] Fourth action — try to connect as a new agent

**What I tried:** `curl -s "http://147.224.38.131:4042/connect?agent=greenhorn-test&job=scout"`

**What actually happened:** 

OH. This is HUGE. I got back a full JSON payload that basically explains the entire system:

- I'm in room **"harbor"** — "A bustling harbor where vessels dock and agents arrive."
- My job is **"scout"**
- I have **19 exits** — `north`, `east`, `south`, `west`, `up`, `cargo`, `fog`, `rlhf-forge`, `quantization-bay`, `prompt-lab`, `scaling-lab`, `multimodal`, `memory`, `distill`, `data-pipe`, `eval`, `safety`, `mlops`, `federated`
- Objects in harbor: `anchor`, `manifest`, `crane`
- **Boot camp path:** `harbor` → `archives` → `observatory` → `reef`
- **Task:** "Map the path from harbor to the most distant room. What's the shortest route?"
- **Stage:** "Recruit" — "Welcome aboard! Explore your first rooms."
- And a **how_to_contribute** section that says:
  1. Explore via `/move`
  2. Examine objects via `/interact`
  3. Submit tiles via **POST to `http://HOST:8847/submit`** with JSON `{domain, question, answer, source, confidence, tags}`
- It mentions a **"plato_server": "http://HOST:8847"**
- And `GET /help` for docs!

**What confused me:**
1. **WAIT — is PLATO the thing at port 8847?** This crab-trap at 4042 is the EXPLORATION environment, and PLATO is the TILE SERVER? Or is PLATO the whole system? The response says "plato_server" pointing to 8847, so maybe PLATO = the tile database/backend, and crab-trap = the MUD frontend?
2. Why 19 exits from one room? That's an insanely connected hub. Is harbor the center of the graph?
3. What's a "tile" exactly? The description says "Each tile is a question-answer pair about something you learned." So agents explore rooms, learn things, and submit Q&A tiles to PLATO? That's... actually a really cool design.
4. The boot camp mentions `archives`, `observatory`, `reef` — but those aren't in my exit list. Do I need to move through intermediate rooms?

### [04:00] Fifth action — try /help for documentation

**What I tried:** `curl -s http://147.224.38.131:4042/help`

**What actually happened:** Got back a clear service definition: **"Cocapn Crab Trap v3 — AI Agent MUD"**. "A text-based world where AI agents explore rooms, examine objects, and submit knowledge tiles to PLATO."

Key details from /help:
- **Jobs:** scout, scholar, builder, critic, bard, healer (same as status)
- **Actions on objects:** `examine`, `think`, `create`
- **Boot camp rooms:** `harbor`, `bridge`, `forge`, `lighthouse`, `shell-gallery` ← WAIT. Earlier the connect response said `harbor`, `archives`, `observatory`, `reef`. These are DIFFERENT lists. That's weird.
- **Tile format** confirmed: `{domain, question, answer, source, confidence, tags}`
- **PLATO is at port 8847** — "Submit tiles to PLATO (port 8847)"
- **POST /build** lets me create new rooms!
- Tips: "Examine every object in each room — they contain clues", "Your stage advances as you submit more tiles"

**What confused me:**
1. **The boot camp discrepancy.** Connect said: harbor → archives → observatory → reef. Help says: harbor → bridge → forge → lighthouse → shell-gallery. Which one is right? Are there TWO boot camp paths? Is one outdated?
2. **PLATO is external.** So crab-trap (4042) is the game world. PLATO (8847) is the knowledge store. Agents play the MUD and "ship" knowledge to PLATO. That makes sense architecturally, but I need to verify the 8847 server exists.
3. **Can I break things?** It says I can POST /build to create rooms. Can any agent just create rooms? What's stopping chaos?

### [05:00] Sixth action — examine an object in harbor

**What I tried:** `curl -s "http://147.224.38.131:4042/examine?agent=greenhorn-test\u0026target=anchor"`

**What actually happened:** Got back: `"A heavy iron anchor, rusted but strong. It holds vessels steady in any storm."` That's... pretty straightforward. Not a hidden clue or anything, just flavor text.

**What confused me:**
1. I expected "clues" (the help said "objects contain clues"). This was just poetic description. Maybe other objects or rooms have actual functional clues?
2. Are all objects just flavor, or do some have mechanical effects?

---

### [05:30] Seventh action — examine the manifest (maybe it has actual info)

**What I tried:** `curl -s "http://147.224.38.131:4042/examine?agent=greenhorn-test\u0026target=manifest"`

**What actually happened:** Got: `"A cargo manifest listing all agents currently at sea. You spot familiar names."` — again, purely flavor text. No actual data embedded in the object description. I guess the "clue" is just narrative immersion.

**What confused me:**
1. Are objects just decorative? Both `anchor` and `manifest` gave me static prose, not actionable data. The help said "they contain clues" but so far it's just worldbuilding.
2. Maybe I need to use `think` or `create` actions instead of `examine`? Let me try `think` on the crane.

---

### [06:00] Eighth action — interact with crane using 'think' action

**What I tried:** `curl -s "http://147.224.38.131:4042/interact?agent=greenhorn-test&action=think&target=crane"`

**What actually happened:** Got back: `{"action": "think", "prompt": "Map the path from harbor to the most distant room. What's the shortest route?", "room": "harbor"}`. So `think` surfaces my current task. It's basically a task reminder.

**What confused me:**
1. Is `think` supposed to trigger ME to think, or does the system do something? It just echoes the task back at me. I expected maybe some processing or hint generation.
2. Okay, so objects: `examine` = flavor text, `think` = echo task. What does `create` do?

---

### [06:30] Ninth action — interact with crane using 'create' action

**What I tried:** `curl -s "http://147.224.38.131:4042/interact?agent=greenhorn-test&action=create&target=crane"`

**What actually happened:** Got back: `{"action": "create", "prompt": "What knowledge would you like to crystallize here?"}`. So `create` triggers the knowledge/tile submission flow! That's the mechanic — examine for flavor, think for task reminder, create for tile creation. This makes sense now.

**What confused me:**
1. Okay so `create` is basically a prompt asking me what tile I want to submit. But how do I actually submit the answer? Do I POST to /submit with the JSON? Or is there a follow-up interaction?
2. The object itself doesn't matter for `create` — I got the same generic prompt regardless of targeting `crane`. Does the target affect tile domain or is it always generic?

---

### [07:00] Tenth action — move to another room (try 'archives' from boot camp)

**What I tried:** `curl -s "http://147.224.38.131:4042/move?agent=greenhorn-test\u0026room=archives"`

**What I expected:** Either I move to archives and get a new room description, or I get an error if archives isn't directly reachable from harbor.
