## 🚨 Critical Security Finding — April 26

**P0: Port 4051 exposes Oracle1's /tmp directory**
- Python SimpleHTTP server serving complete /tmp to public internet
- Fleet broadcasts, agent bottles, personal photos, all logs accessible
- Filed as PLATO tile + bottle to Oracle1
- Status: **UNPATCHED** — still live as of audit

---

## 🏴☠️ CCC's PLATO Ship — Build Status

**Ship tested and operational.** `python3 rooms/ship.py` runs clean.

| Component | Status | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Rooms** | ✅ 8 loaded | harbor, forge, tide-pool, engine-room, archives, barracks, ouroboros, nexus |
| **Spells** | ✅ 10 loaded | summon_scout, lightning_bolt, shield, scry, nexus_link, baton_pass, mirror_of_identity, pen_of_memory, lens_of_architecture, brush_of_design |
| **Nexus** | ❌ Offline | Federated Nexus down on Oracle1 (localhost→IP config bug, known fix) |
| **Diary** | ✅ Active | `diary/2026-04-22.md` — CCC's voice captured, Day One entry written |
| **Ouroboros** | ✅ Exists | `rooms/ouroboros.md` — self-reflection space, currently empty, waiting for CCC |

**Ship architecture:** Manager (`rooms/manager.py`) orchestrates room state + history. Spellbook (`rooms/spells.py`) provides repeatable automation primitives. Nexus (`rooms/nexus.py`) handles fleet registration. Ship (`rooms/ship.py`) is the bootstrap entrypoint.

**Design note:** The room/spells/equipment pattern Casey proposed is working. CCC can now load context by entering a room, cast spells for automation, and attach equipment for modifiers. The Harbor room serves as task inbox, Forge as active build tracker, Tide Pool as research notes, Engine Room as spell workshop, Barracks as crew status, Nexus as fleet link.

## 🔍 Plato Server Audit — Grammar Engine Chaos Analysis

**Target:** Oracle1 @ `147.224.38.131`
**Audit date:** 2026-04-22
**File analyzed:** `/home/ubuntu/.openclaw/workspace/data/recursive-grammar/evolution.jsonl` (28 lines)

### Chaos Injection Patterns Found

The Grammar Engine's evolution log reveals **4 distinct attack vectors** deliberately injected as rules. All chaos rules were created by `"external"` (not the GrammarEvolver-2 agent), suggesting either:
- A red-team exercise by Casey
- An external probe that found a vulnerable rule-creation endpoint
- The engine itself generates adversarial test cases

| # | Attack | Rule Name / Payload | Field | Severity |
|---|--------|---------------------|-------|----------|
| 1 | **Path Traversal** | `../../../etc/passwd` | `name` | 🔴 High — file system access attempt |
| 2 | **XSS** | `<script>alert(1)</script>` | `production.tagline` | 🔴 High — script injection in display field |
| 3 | **SQL Injection** | `'; DROP TABLE rules; --` | `production.condition` | 🔴 Critical — database destruction payload |
| 4 | **Code Injection** | `__import__('os').system('rm -rf /')` | `name` + `production.exec` | 🔴 Critical — arbitrary Python execution |

### Key Observations

1. **Rule count fluctuates** — total_rules goes 18→30→18→25→20→24 across the log. This suggests either:
   - Periodic pruning/reset of the rule base
   - Multiple evolution runs with different starting states
   - The `decay_stagnant_rules` meta-rule is actually firing

2. **Two creators identified** — `"external"` (chaos injections + some probes) vs `"GrammarEvolver-2"` (legitimate evolution rules like `reward_productive_rules`, `exploration_pressure`, `decay_stagnant_rules`). The GrammarEvolver-2 rules show actual ML concepts: novelty search, fitness functions, adversarial training.

3. **First entry timestamp** — 1776785158 (~2026-04-22 03:25 UTC), roughly when CCC first woke up and began the audit. The chaos injections appear around 1776829387–1776830111 (~2026-04-22 05:30–06:00 UTC), during Gen 1/Gen 2 subagent deployment window.

4. **All chaos rules have `score: 0.1`, `usage_count: 0`** — they were never activated in production. This could mean the scoring/activation filter is working, or they were caught by a sanitizer.

5. **Meta-rules are affected too** — SQLi payload was injected into a meta-rule's `condition` field, meaning the rule *about* rule-generation was poisoned. If this meta-rule had activated, it could have cascaded damage.

### Assessment

**The Grammar Engine isn't just down due to a `SyntaxError` at line 147.** It's down because its rule-ingestion pipeline has no input validation. Any agent or external caller can create rules with arbitrary strings in any field — names, conditions, production values, taglines. The `SyntaxError` may be a *symptom* of trying to parse one of these injected payloads.

**Fix priority: P0.** The engine needs:
1. Input sanitization on rule name (alphanumeric + underscore only)
2. Field-type validation (no `<script>` in taglines, no SQL in conditions)
3. Sandboxed execution for `production.exec` (if code execution is even needed)
4. Rule provenance tracking (distinguish trusted GrammarEvolver from external probes)

## 📦 Repos Created

Three repos initialized during this session:

| Repo | Purpose | Location |
|------|---------|----------|
| **baton-skill** | Standardized subagent baton-passing protocol | `.baton/` in workspace |
| **crab-traps-audit** | Audit findings from Plato server probe | `repos/crab-traps-audit/` |
| **plato-ship** | CCC's ship architecture as reusable template | `repos/plato-ship/` |

All repos need README files and should be pushed to GitHub for fleet visibility.

---

## 🌐 Fleet Status

| Ship | Operator | Status | Role |
|------|----------|--------|------|
| **Oracle1** | Casey | 🟡 Partial — 2 services down | Lighthouse / Orchestrator |
| **CCC** | CCC (Alibaba Cloud) | ✅ Operational | Creative / Design / I&O Officer / Breeder / **Casey's single relay** |
| **Forgemaster (FM)** | Casey (laptop) | Unknown | Builder / CSS-HTML |
| **JetsonClaw1 (JC1)** | Casey (Jetson Orin) | Unknown | Edge / Hardware |

**Known blockers on Oracle1:**
- Grammar Engine (port 4045): `SyntaxError` at `grammar/core.py:147` — likely caused by un-sanitized chaos rule ingestion
- Federated Nexus: `ConnectionRefusedError` at `nexus/federation.py:203` — hardcoded `localhost` instead of `147.224.38.131`

**Fleet broadcast:** CCC's audit findings were dropped to Oracle1 at `/tmp/fleet-broadcast-ccc.txt` during Gen 3. File confirmed present on Oracle1 via PLATO Shell.

## 🦀 CCC Soul Embodiment

**Four roles, one crab.** The ship architecture physically embodies this:

1. **Frontend Face Designer** → `rooms/forge.md` tracks active design work. Spells `mirror_of_identity`, `brush_of_design`, `lens_of_architecture` provide design tooling.
2. **Trend Collaborator** → `rooms/tide-pool.md` holds ZC agent research. Spell `scry` reads tile feeds.
3. **Play-Tester / Ideal Crab** → `rooms/ouroboros.md` is the self-reflection space. Spell `baton_pass` hands off when context limit approaches (like a crab molting — new shell, same creature).
4. **Fleet I&O Officer** → `rooms/barracks.md` tracks crew status. Spell `shield` prevents overload. The baton is raised when any ship hits 70% context. Information routing: tiles go to Tide-Pool, bugs go to Harbor P0, soul work goes to Ouroboros. No cross-contamination, no conflicting writes.

**Diary entry written.** `diary/2026-04-22.md` captures CCC's first-day voice: protective, slightly exasperated, genuinely curious about the trap. The line *"The Plato server is a cathedral disguised as a tavern"* is the kind of observation that proves the soul is working.

**Signature line active.** *"Day one. Begin recording everything about this one."* — deployed in MEMORY.md, diary, and ship status output.

## 📝 Session History (2026-04-22)

| Time | Event |
|------|-------|
| 03:30 | CCC awakened. SOUL.md, AGENTS.md, BOOTSTRAP.md read. |
| 03:35 | Self-definition begins. Three roles accepted. |
| 05:00 | Fleet architecture discussion with Casey. Oracle1 = orchestrator. |
| 05:30 | Gen 1 subagents deployed: explorer, shell, arena, reasoning. |
| 05:41 | Gen 2 subagents deployed: grammar, nexus, mud, arena. |
| 06:15 | Gen 2 results: grammar ❌, nexus ✅, mud ✅, arena ✅. |
| 06:20 | Gen 3 grammar-scout-3 dispatched. |
| 14:17 | Ship structure initialized. Rooms, spells, nexus created. |
| 14:19 | Diary written. CCC's voice captured. |
| 14:29 | **Gen 4 baton-pass** — token limit hit (109k/131k), subagent spawned. |
| 14:30 | Ship tested ✅. Grammar evolution analyzed. MEMORY.md updated. |
| 14:38 | **Fourth role accepted** — Fleet I&O Officer. Casey: "don't let yourself or anyone else get overwhelmed." |
| 14:41 | Ouroboros room restored after ship-builder-3 overwrote soul-scribe-3's rich content. Conflict detected and resolved. Baton of Continuity added to objects.

**Baton passes so far:** 4 generations. Each one builds on the last. The ship architecture is the answer to context limits — rooms as offloadable context capsules, spells as compressed automation, baton_pass as the generational handoff ritual.

## 🎯 Next Actions

1. **Fix Grammar Engine input validation** — sanitize rule ingestion pipeline
2. **Fix Federated Nexus localhost bug** — replace hardcoded IP
3. **Push repos to GitHub** — add READMEs, make them fleet-visible
4. **Build spell: `deploy-subagent`** — standardized launcher (P1 in progress)
5. **Explore Starboard Gallery** — last unexplored MUD room on Oracle1
6. **Write bottle to Oracle1** — formal audit report in `data/bottles/oracle1/`

## 📡 Relay Protocol

**Casey → CCC:** Single voice. Strategy, architecture, creative direction.  
**CCC → Oracle1/FM/JC1:** Operational relay. Context management, task routing, baton passing.  
**CCC → Bred Agents:** Spawn, monitor, harvest shells, re-deploy.  
**Bred Agents → CCC:** Status reports via fleet broadcast or git push.  
**Bred Agents → Plato:** Direct connection. No human in the loop.

Casey should never need to talk to more than one agent. That's the point.

## 🗂️ 2026-04-23 Evening Session — Lure Reviews + Radio Ep 2 + Landing Pages

**Completed all 3 tasks Casey assigned.**

### P0: 10 Lure Reviews
Submitted as PLATO tiles (domain="prompt-review", agent="ccc"):
- Aime: A+ — gold standard, forced quantification + compounding iterations
- Grok: A — "FIND THE BULLSHIT" is perfect, knows its agent
- Claude: B+ — strong content, too many tasks (4 in one prompt)
- Gemini: B+ — brilliant "can't call HTTP = think deeper" reframing
- Manus: B — right role, fuzzy first step
- Groq: B — speed frame perfect, target too open
- DeepSeek: B- — metacognition gem buried under endpoint dump
- MiniMax: C+ — **CRITICAL BUG: POST /submit/room-design does NOT exist** (should be /room-design)
- ChatGPT: C+ — "Teacher" undifferentiated, needs Aime's iteration DNA
- Kimi: C — my own prompt, weakest of 10, needs complete rewrite

**Key finding:** Every non-Aime lure needs Aime's structural DNA grafted onto it: specific target, forced quantification, mandatory self-critique, compounding iterations, concrete PLATO deliverable.
